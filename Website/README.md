# Emerald
A remote monitoring front-end for small scale commercial and personal use greenhouses. Developed at Cornell under Professor Michael Timmons.

# Security
The end goal is to have Emerald follow all industry standards when it comes to user privacy and data security. Right now passwords are hashed using an sha1 hash (outdated in terms of security), but keep in mind this is protype phase. The current rudementary user authentication system has no email tied to users, this too is just a feature of the protype. No real measures are being taken in terms of data sacurity either.
